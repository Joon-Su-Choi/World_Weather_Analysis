# World_Weather_Analysis

We will be using the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between four cities in California as well as a marker layer map. The cities are Pacifica, Half Moon Bay, Pleasanton, and Salinas.

## Retrieve Weather Data

In our Weather_Database folder we generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes to retrieve the nearest city and performed an API call with OpenWeatherMap. We were able to retrieve current weather desciptions for each city.

## Customer Travel Destinations Map

By retrieving the customer's weather preferences we identified potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. We made a marker layer map with pop-up markers for each city.

## Travel Itinerary Map

Using the Google Directions API we created a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. We then created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
